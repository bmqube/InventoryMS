# X-Fashion Inventory System

The X-Fashion Inventory System is an easy-to-use tool that helps fashion businesses keep track of their stock. It shows how many items you have, their worth in market, and what you need to order. It's designed to work well with other systems, and it's built with up-to-date technology, so it can handle your business as it grows. The system is split into two parts - the part you interact with (frontend) and the part that works in the background (backend), making it easier to manage and fix if needed.
